# Women-Healthcare-Recommendation
Personalized Healthcare Solution for Women

Project Overview

Womenâ€™s healthcare needs are diverse, and generic medical solutions often fail to provide personalized care. This project is a data-driven web application that uses Hierarchical Clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to offer personalized healthcare recommendations for working women, especially those who are pregnant.

The system enables users to input their symptoms and health conditions, after which it suggests appropriate doctors, hospitals, and severity-based actions. By integrating machine learning and location-based services, the platform enhances healthcare accessibility and reduces unnecessary hospital visits while ensuring timely medical intervention.

Key Features

1. Symptom-Based Doctor Recommendations

If a pregnant woman reports symptoms like back pain or fatigue, the system suggests consulting a gynecologist or obstetrician.

For general health issues (e.g., fever, body pain), the system recommends consulting a general physician.


2. Location-Based Doctor & Hospital Suggestions

After identifying the required specialist, the system lists nearby hospitals and doctors to ensure easy access to medical care.

The integration of Google Maps API helps users locate healthcare providers efficiently.


3. Symptom Severity-Based Actions

Users can rate their symptoms as low, medium, or high, allowing for personalized recommendations:

Low severity: Home remedies, rest, or simple exercises.

Medium severity: Monitoring symptoms and consulting a doctor if they persist.

High severity: Immediate medical consultation is strongly advised.



4. Personalized Health Guidance

The system empowers women to make informed healthcare decisions, helping them understand when to seek medical attention or manage symptoms at home.
